    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the best and only way to make good peanut butter at home</p>
        <p>Children will love it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (300g) unsalted shelled peanuts</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 to 3 teaspoons peanut or vegetable oil, as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Add the peanuts to a round or square cake pan (or small-rimmed baking sheet).</li> 
        <li>Roast the peanuts in the oven for 3 minutes, shake the pan, then roast another 3 to 5 minutes or until they are lightly browned and smell nutty (watch them to prevent over-browning). Let them cool until you can handle them.</li> 
        <li>For crunchy peanut butter, add 1/3 cup of the roasted peanuts to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 6 to 8 times or until the peanuts are chopped small. Transfer the chopped peanuts to a bowl and reserve for later.</li>
        <li>Add the roasted peanuts to a food processor bowl (save the chopped peanuts for adding later if you are making crunchy).</li>
        <li>Process the peanuts for 1 minute, then scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Process another 2 to 3 minutes until the peanut butter is shiny and smooth. The peanuts will go from crumbly and very dry to a clumpy mixture and finally to smooth and shiny.</li>
        <li>Add your desired amount of salt and maple syrup or honey, then process until combined. We add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Check the consistency of your peanut butter. If it seems too thick, add oil, a teaspoon at a time, until you are happy with it.</li>
        <li>For crunchy peanut butter, stir in the reserved peanuts.</li>
    </ol>
